<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p1>Welcome to the introduction design project, focused on gamifying a learning app.</p1> 
    <p1>Our aim is to make the learning experience more engaging and interactive for our users</p1>
  <br></br>
<p2>Gamification involves applying game design principles to non-game context, such as education.</p2>
<p2>The objective is to increase user motivation, engagement and enjoyment.</p2>
  <br></br>
<p3>This project involves various phases, including a competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and usabilty testing.</p3>
<p3>The competitive analysis will help me identify strengths and weaknesses in the exsisting market, and highlight on areas we can improve.</p3>
<br></br>
<p4>Wireframing and prototyping allowed us to design and develop the interface and user experience of the app, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable learning process.</p4>
<br></br>
<p5>Finally, usability testing was conducted to gather feedback from users on the app's usability and functionality.</5> 
  <p5>The feedback will be used to refine and improve the app, ensuring that the user's needs are met.</p5>
<br></br>
<p6>Overall, our aim is to create a learning app that is not only effective but also enjoyable, ultimately improving the user's learning outcomes.</p6>
